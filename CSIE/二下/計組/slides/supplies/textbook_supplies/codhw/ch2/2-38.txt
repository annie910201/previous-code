0x10000000: 0x11223344
byte    :   0       1       2       3
value   :   11      22      33      44

so instruction lbu would read byte 11 into register t0. So resulting value in register will be 0x00000011

instruction sw $t0, 0($t2) would value in memory as
0x00000011


if the above problem was with little endian (little end first)
byte    :   0       1       2       3
value   :   44      33      22      11

answer would be: 0x00000044
