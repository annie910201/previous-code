Compute sum and carry for 1 bit is 2T for carry look ahead and ripple carry adder.

Since in 4 bit carry look ahead adder all four bit are computed in parallel hence it consumes 2T time.

In ripple carry adder next bit depends on previous bit carry. So it consumes 
2T + 2T + 2T + 2T = 8T

Performance ratio = 8T / 2T = 4 . 
Means 4 bit ripple carry adder is 4 times slower than 4 bit carry look ahead adder.
