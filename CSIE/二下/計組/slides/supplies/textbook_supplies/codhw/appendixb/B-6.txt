Construct And, Not, Or gate using NAND gate

NAND Truth Table
A       B   |   Y
0       0   |   1
0       1   |   1
1       0   |   1
1       1   |   0

Law used in solving this problem
1. Involution Law
    ~(~A) = A

2. Idempotency Law
    A + A = A
    A.A   = A

3. DeMorgan's Law
    ~(A+B) = ~A.~B
    ~(A.B) = ~A + ~B

Y = ~(A.B)

AND Function using NAND
Y = ~(~(A.B))

NOT Function using NAND
Y = ~(A.A)

OR Function using NAND
Y = ~(~(A.A) + ~(B.B))
