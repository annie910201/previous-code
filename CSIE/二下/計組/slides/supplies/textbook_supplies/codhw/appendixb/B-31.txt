For carry save addition of 3 numbers scheme logic equation for carry and sum

sum = a XOR b XOR c
carry = c.(a XOR b) + A.B

both equation contains two level of logic hence both equation can compute result
in 2T time.

As seen in exercise B-29 16 bit carry look ahead adder would take 8T time to computer result
when used in ripple carry of 4 bit lookahead carry units.
So to compute sum of four 16 bit number it would need 4 * 8T = 32T

For carry save addition scheme operation would follow as below
a
b
c
--
sum 
carry 
d
----
sum_i
carry_i
-------
final sum

a+b+c would consume 2T
sum+carry+d would consume 2T
sum_i + carry_i would consume 8T (16 bit carry look ahead adder)
Total time consumed = 2T + 2T + 8T = 12T

Means its carry save is 2.66 time faster than look ahead adders
