Time Ripple carry = 2T X 64 = 128T

Time Carry Look ahead (4 bit group) = 2T X 16 = 32T

Time Carry Look ahead (16 bit group) = 2T X 4 = 8T

I Doubt the correctness of below argument.

Time Carry Look ahead Second Level = 2T + 2T = 4T

Ratios
-----
Time_ripple/Time_LHC_4Bit = 128T / 32T = 4

Time_ripple/Time_LHC_16Bit = 128T / 8T = 16

I Doubt the correctness of below argument.

Time_ripple/Time_LHC_2nd_level = 128T / 4T = 32
