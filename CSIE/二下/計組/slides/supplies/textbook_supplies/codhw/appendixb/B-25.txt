Simple check for overflow is carry in to most significant bit is not same as carry out.
We prove this point use a examples
Lets say we have 4 bit signed numbers for simplicity

Case 1: A>=0 and B>=0
For overflow sum should be greater than 7
So we choose A = 7, B = 1 
A + B = 8 (should be)
doing binary addition
A:      0111
B:      0001
-------------
S:      1000 (-8)
Here we can see carry in to msb(s) is 1 and carry out of msb(s) is 0

Case 2: A<0 and B<0
For overflow sum should be less than -8
So we choose A = -8, B = -7 
A + B = -15 (should be)
doing binary addition
A:      1000
B:      1001
-------------
S:    1)0001 (1)
Here we can see carry in to msb(s) is 0 and carry out of msb(s) is 1

Hence we proved the hypothesis.
