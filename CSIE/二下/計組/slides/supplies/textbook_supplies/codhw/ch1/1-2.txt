a. Assembly line in automobile manufacturing - Performance via Pipelining

b. Suspension bridge cables - Dependability via Redundancy

c. Aircraft and marine navigation system that incorporate wind information - Performance via Prediction

d. Express elevators in building - Make the Common Cast Fast

e. Library reserve desk - Hierarchy of Memories

f. Increase the gate area on a CMOS transistor to decrease its switching time - Performance via Parallelism

g. Adding electromagnetic aircraft catapults (which are electrically - powered as opposed to current steam - powered
   models), allowed by the increased power generation offered by the new reactor technology - Design for Moore's Law

h. Building self-driving cars whose controls system partially rely on existing sensor system already installed into the base
   vehicle, such as lane departure systems and smart cruise control system - Use Abstraction to Simplify Design
