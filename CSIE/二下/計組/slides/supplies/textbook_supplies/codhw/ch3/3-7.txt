185 = 1011 1001
122 = 0111 1010
185 (unsigned) = -71 (signed)
122 (unsigned) = 122 (signed)
unsigned        binary             signed
185             1011 1001           -57
122          +  0111 1010           122
----            ---------           ---
                0100 0001           65





therefore 185 + 122 = -57 + 122 = 65
it does not overflow
