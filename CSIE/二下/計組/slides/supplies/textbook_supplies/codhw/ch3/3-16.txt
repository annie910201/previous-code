Total adder required for multiplication of 8 bit number = 7
Adder will be arranged in tree structure. 
Each adder takes 4 time units to compute result
All adder in same level would compute result in parallel
Total levels in tree structure = log2(8) = 3

Total time required for multiplication = 3 * 4 = 12 time units
