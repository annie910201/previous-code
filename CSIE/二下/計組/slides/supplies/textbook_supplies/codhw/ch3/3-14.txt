Total number of iteration required for multiplication of 8 bit number are 8.
i.e. Total iteration = 8
Each operation = 4 time units
In hardware step 2 and 3 can be done in parallel

For hardware
------------
1 Cycle - add
1 Cycle - shift
1 Cycle - check loop condition

Therefore Total Cycles = 3
Total time = 8 * 3 * 4 = 96 time units

For software
------------
1 Cycle - Decide what to add
1 Cycle - add
1 Cycle - left shift
1 Cycle - right shift
1 Cycle - check loop condition

Therefore Total Cycle = 5 
Total time = 8 * 5 * 4 = 160 time units
