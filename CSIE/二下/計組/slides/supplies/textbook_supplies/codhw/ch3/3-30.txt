Num1: â€“8.0546875 X 10E0
Binary: -1000.0000111 = -1.0000000111 X 2E3 


Num2: -1.79931640625 X 10E-1 = -0.179931640625 X 10E0 
Binary: -0.001011100001 = -1.0111000010 X 2E-3 


Step 1: Add exponents
3 + (-3) = 0
-14 <= -3 <= 15

or baised exponent
(3+15) + (-3+15) - 15 = 18 + 12 - 15 = 15
1 <= 15 <= 30

Actual exponent = 15 -15 = 0 

Step 2: Multiply significants
    1.0000000111
X   1.0111000010
    1.0111001100 0 0 1 100111
                 G R S


Step 3: Normalize product if required and then check the exponent for overflow or underflow
Product already normalized 1.0111001100 and exponent is zero well within the range


Step 4: Round the product
Since only sticky bit is set and combined value of G R S is less than half of
least significant bit. Not need to round result


Step 5: Set sign of product according to signs of operands
Both number are -ve hence sign of product is +ve.

final result = 1.0111001100 X 2E0 = 1.44921875
-2, -3, -4, -7, -8
result using calculator = 1.449293137
